**Goals and Objectives:**  
The student’s primary goal is to deepen their expertise in quantitative modeling, data science, and statistical analysis as applied to real-world credit risk problems. Through work-based learning, the student aims to enhance their skills in advanced data querying, feature engineering, predictive modeling, and performance monitoring of analytical models. Specific techniques to be developed include using Python for algorithm design, leveraging BigQuery for scalable data processing, and building visual dashboards in Looker Studio to communicate findings.

The student will achieve these objectives through active participation in end-to-end modeling projects, mentorship from senior analysts and model developers, and iterative feedback on deliverables. Assignments will provide hands-on experience with large-scale data pipelines, cloud-based data ecosystems (Google Cloud Platform), and model validation processes. These activities directly build upon the student’s STEM academic foundation in industrial engineering and advanced analytics, reinforcing concepts from coursework in statistical methods, machine learning, and data visualization while promoting continuous learning in an applied environment.
