The bot already checks for presence — so why build a model?

You're right to ask this. The model doesn't replace the bot, but it adds valuable intelligence on top of what the bot detects. Here's how:

1. The Bot Flags Missing Documents — But Can’t Prioritize Risk  
The bot does a binary check: is a required document present or not?  
The model learns from history which missing documents actually led to rework.  
This allows the model to prioritize high-impact misses (e.g., missing LexisNexis for a Casino is worse than missing a basic screenshot for a low-risk business).  
Bot = binary rule-check  
Model = data-informed risk assessment

2. The Bot Treats All Review Elements Equally — The Model Doesn’t  
The bot flags any required document that is missing.  
But not all documents are equally important — the model learns which documents matter more in different contexts.  
For example, missing UBO documents might be more critical for complex entities than individuals.

3. The Model Learns from Historical Human Judgments  
Even when documents were missing, 2LOD reviewers sometimes still marked the report as "Satisfactory".  
The model learns these human judgment patterns and can mimic them, reducing unnecessary rework.  
This is something the bot cannot do, since it follows strict presence/absence rules.

4. Combines Presence Signals into a Holistic Risk Score  
The model converts dozens of presence/absence indicators into a single interpretable probability score.  
This simplifies downstream review and helps QA teams prioritize work instead of reading 50+ binary flags.

5. Reduces False Positives from the Bot  
The bot might flag minor issues as rework-worthy even when they aren't.  
The model learns what is usually tolerated and what actually triggers rework — leading to fewer false positives and more accurate prioritization.

6. Makes QA Review Smarter and More Targeted  
The model can specifically identify cases where 1LOD labeled something "Satisfactory", but the feature pattern looks risky.  
This enables smarter 2LOD intervention — something the bot cannot infer on its own.

Analogy:  
Think of the bot as a spell-checker — it flags missing items.  
Think of the model as a proofreader — it tells you if the overall review still makes sense or needs revision.

One-line summary:  
“The bot checks for missing documents; the model learns from real outcomes to decide which missing pieces actually matter.”
