Perfect ‚Äî you‚Äôre breaking this down exactly the way Model Risk, Credit Policy, or Senior Modeling leads would expect. Below is a suggested slide-by-slide breakdown (titles + bullet content) for presenting your rolling window Chi-squared segmentation analysis methodically and convincingly.

‚∏ª

üìä Slide 1: Objective of Segmentation Justification

Title: Justifying Segmentation Strategy for PD Modeling

Content:
	‚Ä¢	Goal: Demonstrate that commitment-based segmentation (‚â§3MM vs >3MM) is statistically meaningful
	‚Ä¢	Compare against legacy segmentation (e.g., MM, Institutional, Leasing)
	‚Ä¢	Use rigorous hypothesis testing to support model governance and validation

‚öñÔ∏è Slide 2: Statistical Test Used

Title: Why Use a Chi-Squared Test?

Content:
	‚Ä¢	Hypothesis:
	‚Ä¢	Null (H‚ÇÄ): Default rates are the same across segments
	‚Ä¢	Alternative (H‚ÇÅ): Default rates differ across segments
	‚Ä¢	Chi-squared test is ideal for:
	‚Ä¢	Binary outcomes (default vs no-default)
	‚Ä¢	Categorical grouping (e.g., commitment segment or legacy segment)
	‚Ä¢	Requires a 2x2 contingency table:
	‚Ä¢	Rows: Segment groups (e.g., ‚â§3MM vs >3MM)
	‚Ä¢	Columns: Default = 1 or 0

üì¶ Slide 3: Why Collapse to One Row per Obligor?

Title: Panel Data Must Be Collapsed to Avoid Bias

Content:
	‚Ä¢	Raw data is at obligor √ó time (panel) level
	‚Ä¢	Chi-squared test assumes independent observations
	‚Ä¢	Including multiple records per obligor would:
	‚Ä¢	Inflate sample size
	‚Ä¢	Violate independence assumption
	‚Ä¢	Overstate significance
	‚Ä¢	Solution: Create 1 row per obligor, capturing their:
	‚Ä¢	First observed features (T‚ÇÄ)
	‚Ä¢	Default outcome (e.g., within 12 months of T‚ÇÄ)

‚è≥ Slide 4: Why Use a Rolling Window?

Title: Rolling Windows Capture Economic Variation

Content:
	‚Ä¢	Default behavior is time-dependent (e.g., pre vs post-COVID)
	‚Ä¢	Splitting data into time windows lets us:
	‚Ä¢	Control for macroeconomic effects
	‚Ä¢	Compare how segmentation performs in different cycles
	‚Ä¢	Prevents one ‚Äúbad year‚Äù from dominating full-sample results
	‚Ä¢	Increases transparency and robustness

‚∏ª

üîÑ Slide 5: Rolling Window Methodology

Title: How the Rolling Window Method Works

Content:
	‚Ä¢	Step 1: Define rolling 4-year windows (e.g., 2010‚Äì2013, 2014‚Äì2017)
	‚Ä¢	Step 2: For each obligor, select first snapshot (T‚ÇÄ) within that window
	‚Ä¢	Step 3: Track if obligor defaulted within 12 months
	‚Ä¢	Step 4: Build contingency table by segment vs default
	‚Ä¢	Step 5: Run Chi-squared tests for:
	‚Ä¢	Commitment segmentation
	‚Ä¢	Legacy segmentation
	‚Ä¢	Repeat steps for each window and compare test statistics

üìà (Optional Next Slide: Visualization Preview)

Title: Preview: Statistical Power Across Windows

Content (placeholder for next slides):
	‚Ä¢	Chi-squared statistic across time shows which segmentation better separates default behavior
	‚Ä¢	Helps determine if commitment cutoff is stable and meaningful
