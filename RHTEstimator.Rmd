This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(plm)

# -----------------------------------------------------------
# 1) Read in your data from a .dat file
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# Example: data file "mydata.dat" with columns:
#   id, t, lwage, wks, union, exp, exp2, south, smsa, fem, blk, ed
# Adjust the path, separators, and other arguments as needed.
df_r <- read.table("/psidextract.dat", header = TRUE)

# -----------------------------------------------------------
# 2) Convert to a panel-data frame
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# index = c("id","t") indicates "id" is the individual, "t" is the time dimension
df_r <- plm.data(df_r, index = c("id", "t"))



```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
