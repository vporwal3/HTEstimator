Hi Jordan,

Thanks for the clarification — that helps. I’ve currently fitted the model using an ARX framework on the raw quarterly series. Would it make sense for me to generate a forward forecast based on that model to evaluate how the trend behaves, and compare it to the CASTA baseline?

Happy to adjust the approach if you have something else in mind as well — just let me know how you’d like me to proceed.

Best,
Vansh

Hi Team,

There are two automation projects currently in progress, and I wanted to share a quick overview of our role in each:

**1. CDD/EDD Document Summarization**  
The objective here is to use Copilot to generate summaries from CDD/EDD reports. Our task will be to craft effective prompts that guide Copilot to extract key insights from these documents. For example, we might input a Lexis Nexis report and use a prompt like:  
*“Summarize key risk indicators and findings from this document.”*

**2. Risk Report Deck Creation**  
This project involves building a slide deck from a Tableau report. A bot extracts charts, tables, and other artifacts from Tableau and compiles them into PowerPoint slides. Our role is to write prompts for Copilot to generate summaries of these artifacts and enhance the slides with meaningful narratives.  
We’ll also explore:
- The best format to provide the artifacts to Copilot (e.g., table as image vs. Excel/CSV)
- Whether to summarize multiple slides/artifacts at once or one at a time

Let me know if you'd like to brainstorm ideas or set up a quick sync.

Would you like a shorter or more casual version too?

    return df



This is because the cointegration regression already captures any deterministic components, and the residuals should be tested purely for stationarity around zero without adding any additional trend or constant terms. 





Thanks for the feedback!
I agree the original statement was a bit vague — apologies for the confusion.
What I meant by “somewhat like regression parameter” is that the trend option in the cointegration test plays a similar role conceptually — it specifies the deterministic components (constant/trend) in the cointegration regression, just like the regression option in a standard ADF test specifies the deterministic terms.

	In terms of choosing the trend parameter: it should be based on the behavior of the original series — if they have no drift or trend, use “n”; if they have drift but no strong trend, use “c”; and if they have strong visible trends, use “ct”.

	And yes, you are correct — the ADF test on the residuals is run with option “n” by default, without access to modify it. Thanks again for pointing this out — I’ll update the wording to be more precise.


Observation from Original Series (Y, X),Drift present?,Clear Trend?,Use trend=,Why?
Series fluctuate randomly around zero (pure random walk),No,No,"n" (no constant, no trend),No drift, no trend; series are purely random without systematic movement
Series gradually rise or fall over time (small consistent upward or downward drift),Yes,No,"c" (constant only),There is a drift (mean offset), but no strong trend shaping the data
Series steadily and strongly increase or decrease over time (clear straight trend line),Yes,Yes,"ct" (constant + linear trend),Series have a deterministic trend component (systematic long-term slope)







Thanks — understood. So you’re suggesting we should ideally look for variables that are I(1) without trend (i.e., not trend-stationary), to avoid spurious cointegration due to shared deterministic trends. Will make sure to check both 'c' and 'ct' cases during ADF.
Absolutely! Here's a clear, concise, and copy-ready **summary** for your report on **why the constant term should be included during VIF calculation**, backed by **mathematical and statistical intuition**:

---

### **Why Include the Constant Term When Calculating VIFs**

When calculating Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) for explanatory variables, it is important to **include the constant (intercept) term** in the regression used to compute \( R^2 \), even though the VIF of the intercept itself is **not interpreted**.

#### **Mathematical Intuition:**
VIF for a predictor \( X_j \) is defined as:

\[
\text{VIF}_j = \frac{1}{1 - R_j^2}
\]

where \( R_j^2 \) is the coefficient of determination from regressing \( X_j \) on all other predictors.

Excluding the constant term forces the regression through the origin, which **biases the \( R^2 \)** value — especially if the predictors are not mean-centered. This distortion can lead to **inflated or understated VIFs**. Including the constant ensures that \( R^2 \) reflects a correctly specified regression model that matches the structure of most real-world applications, where intercepts are standard.

#### **Best Practice:**
- **Include** the constant term in the design matrix when computing VIFs.
- **Ignore** and **exclude** the VIF value of the constant term from interpretation, as it is inherently high and not meaningful.

This approach maintains mathematical consistency and provides reliable diagnostics for detecting multicollinearity among explanatory variables.

Let me know if you want this in slide format or a version with an example!

Situation,Use trend=,Why
Both y and x trend, but y - x is stable over time,'c',Residuals (long-run spread) revert to a constant
Both y and x trend, and the gap between them also trends,'ct',Long-run relationship includes a time trend
Both series are zero-mean and flat (rare),'n',No constant/trend needed — not common in finance



trend, maxlag, and autolag in coint() work similarly to adfuller(), because under the hood, the Engle-Granger cointegration test in statsmodels.coint() uses the ADF test on the residuals from the cointegration regression.

Here’s a concise, copy-ready summary for your report summarizing all three ADF test parameter choices for **quarterly bank fee income and expenses data (2000–2024):**

---

### **ADF Test Configuration Summary (Quarterly Data, 2000–2024):**

- **Regression Component (`regression='c'` and `'ct'`):**  
  Both a constant-only model (`'c'`) and a constant plus linear trend model (`'ct'`) were tested to account for the potential presence of a structural trend in the time series. This ensures robustness in detecting stationarity, as financial series often exhibit long-term growth or drift.

- **Lag Selection Strategy (`autolag='AIC'`):**  
  The Akaike Information Criterion was used to automatically select the optimal number of lags. AIC balances model fit with complexity and is well-suited for medium-sized time series such as quarterly economic data.

- **Maximum Lag Length (`maxlag=None`):**  
  The maximum lag was determined automatically using the Schwert rule, which adjusts based on sample size. For ~100 quarterly observations, this yields a maximum lag of 12, allowing the model to consider up to 3 years of past behavior while avoiding overfitting.

---

Let me know if you want a version tailored for slides or a table format too!




regression	'ct' or 'c'	Try both: 'ct' if there’s a clear upward/downward trend; 'c' if flat but non-zero mean

Why autolag='AIC'?

	•	Your sample size (n = 300) is large enough that AIC won’t overfit easily.
	•	AIC balances goodness of fit with complexity, making it a robust choice for business/financial data.
	•	BIC is more conservative (fewer lags), but in your case, the cost of missing important lags is higher than overfitting slightly.

Why maxlag=24 is safe:

	•	Monthly data → lag 12 = 1 year, lag 24 = 2 years
	•	You may want to capture annual and biannual cycles common in fee-based revenue/expenses (e.g., seasonal fees, bonuses, compliance cycles).
	•	If you leave maxlag=None, statsmodels will use Schwert’s rule:


\text{maxlag} = \lfloor 12 \cdot (n / 100)^{1/4} \rfloor = \lfloor 12 \cdot (3)^{1/4} \rfloor = \lfloor 12 \cdot 1.316 \rfloor = \lfloor 15.8 \rfloor = 15


→ So it will test up to 15 lags, which is okay, but 24 gives more flexibility if you’re concerned about seasonal structure.


autolag,maxlag,What happens
'AIC',None,Tries 0 to maxlag (computed via Schwert rule), chooses best lag based on AIC
'BIC',None,Same as above but based on BIC
None,5,ADF test uses exactly 5 lags (no optimization)
None,None,ADF test uses 0 lags — just a basic regression without lagged differences




	1.	Plot the time series.
	2.	Ask:
	•	Does the mean look like zero? → 'n'
	•	Is there a visible upward/downward slope? → 'ct'
	•	Is it flat but off-zero? → 'c'
	•	Any curved pattern (e.g., bowl or hill)? → 'ctt'



Sure! Here's a clean, copy-paste-ready summary for your report on **max lag selection in the ADF test**:

---

### **Summary: Choosing the Appropriate `maxlag` in the ADF Test**

Selecting the right `maxlag` is critical for balancing model validity and test power:

- **Max lag too low:**
  - May fail to capture autocorrelation in residuals.
  - Can lead to **false detection of stationarity** (Type I error).
  - Risk: **Underfitting** the model.

- **Max lag too high:**
  - Consumes degrees of freedom, especially in short time series.
  - Increases risk of **overfitting**, reducing the test’s power to reject the null.
  - Can produce **unstable or spurious results** due to small effective sample size.

- **Ideal max lag (rule of thumb):**
  - Let `maxlag=None` to use the **Schwert rule**:  
    \[
    \text{maxlag} = \lfloor 12 \cdot (n/100)^{1/4} \rfloor
    \]
  - Combine with `autolag='AIC'` or `'BIC'` to select the optimal lag automatically.
  - For small samples (n < 100): cap `maxlag` at 4–6.
  - For high-frequency data (e.g., hourly): consider domain-specific lags (e.g., 24, 48).

Using an appropriate `maxlag` ensures the ADF test retains both statistical validity and power to detect stationarity.

Let me know if you want a table version as well!



No — you should NOT drop the model based on the constant term’s VIF.

Why?

	1.	The intercept is not a predictor — it doesn’t affect predictions in the same way explanatory variables do.
	2.	High VIF for the intercept is normal in models with:
	•	Centered variables (e.g., mean-centered)
	•	Strong correlation among variables and a constant offset
	•	Dummy variable traps or near collinearity with dummies (e.g., when you have an intercept + many categorical levels)
	3.	It doesn’t cause multicollinearity in your actual predictors — the VIF threshold logic applies only to predictors, not the intercept.




Great question! Let's clarify this explicitly:



---

## 1\. Should the constant (intercept) term be included in VIF calculation?

**No**, typically the constant term (**intercept**) should **not** be included in your VIF calculation.

- **Reason:**  
  VIF measures multicollinearity among your independent variables, and the constant term is not considered an explanatory variable. It is simply a baseline or intercept and does not contribute to multicollinearity among predictors.

- Most statistical libraries/packages (e.g., `statsmodels` in Python) automatically handle this by excluding the constant when computing VIF.

---

## 2\. What if you accidentally include the constant term?

- If the constant term is included by mistake, its VIF will often be very high—often extremely large (e.g., 100+)—since it correlates strongly with all variables by construction.
- **However**, a high VIF for the constant is meaningless and doesn't indicate actual multicollinearity issues. You should **ignore** the constant’s VIF in such cases.

**Do not remove** the constant term due to its VIF. It's always acceptable (and necessary) to have an intercept unless your model explicitly needs no intercept (rare).

---

## 3\. Proper procedure to compute VIF correctly (example in Python):

Here's how to correctly calculate VIF, explicitly excluding constant/intercept:

```python
import pandas as pd
from statsmodels.stats.outliers_influence import variance_inflation_factor
import statsmodels.api as sm

# Assume X is your dataframe of independent variables
X_const = sm.add_constant(X)

# Compute VIF for all predictors (skip intercept explicitly)
vif_df = pd.DataFrame({
    "Variable": X_const.columns,
    "VIF": [variance_inflation_factor(X_const.values, i)
            for i in range(X_const.shape[1])]
})

# Exclude the constant term from the output
vif_df_no_const = vif_df[vif_df['Variable'] != 'const']
print(vif_df_no_const)
```

- **Only use VIF values for explanatory variables** (not for "const").

---

## 4\. General VIF thresholds (for explanatory variables):

| VIF Value          | Recommendation                                  |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| VIF < 5            | Usually okay, minimal multicollinearity         |
| 5 ≤ VIF < 10       | Moderate concern, consider investigation        |
| VIF ≥ 10           | High concern, likely remove or transform variable |

---

## Summary clearly:

- **Exclude** constant term from VIF calculations.
- **Ignore** VIF values calculated on constant if included accidentally.
- **Never remove the intercept** because of high VIF.

Only base your decisions on VIF values of actual predictor variables.

Here's a clear, structured guide on choosing appropriate arguments for the **Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF)** test using `statsmodels` (`adfuller`) in Python:

---

## **1. ADF Test with `adfuller()` function**

The `adfuller` function from the `statsmodels.tsa.stattools` module tests for stationarity in a time series.

**Basic Syntax:**

```python
from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import adfuller

adfuller(x, maxlag=None, regression='c', autolag='AIC')
```

---

## **2. Choosing the Appropriate Arguments**

The primary arguments and recommended choices are:

### **a. `x` (required)**  
- The time series data you want to test (e.g., pandas Series or NumPy array).

### **b. `maxlag` (optional)**  
- The maximum lag included in the test.
- If `autolag` is used, `maxlag` is just the maximum lag considered for optimization.  
- Typically, `None` is sufficient; the test automatically selects a suitable lag based on the `autolag` method.

**Recommended choice:**
```python
maxlag = None  # auto-selected by the test
```

### **c. `regression` (important)**  
Specifies the type of deterministic components included in the ADF regression model:

| Option | Meaning                             | Typical Use Case                             |
|--------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `'c'`  | Constant (intercept)                | **Most common** (default), data has non-zero mean |
| `'ct'` | Constant and linear trend           | Data has clear linear trend                  |
| `'ctt'`| Constant, linear, and quadratic trend | Rarely used, strong quadratic trend |
| `'nc'` | No constant, no trend               | Rarely used, data has mean ≈ 0 (centered)    |

**Recommended choice for most applications:**  
```python
regression = 'c'  # most common default choice
```

Use `'ct'` only if a linear trend is visually evident in your data.

### **d. `autolag` (important)**  
Method to automatically select optimal lag length for the ADF regression:

| Option   | Description                                | Recommended |
|----------|--------------------------------------------|-------------|
| `'AIC'`  | Minimizes Akaike Information Criterion     | **Recommended (default)**, robust and widely used |
| `'BIC'`  | Minimizes Bayesian Information Criterion   | Slightly stricter, useful if you prefer fewer lags |
| `'t-stat'` | Based on significance of last lag        | Less common, less stable |
| `None`   | User manually specifies `maxlag`           | Only for advanced cases |

**Recommended choice:**  
```python
autolag = 'AIC'  # default, robust, suitable for most cases
```

---

## **3. Typical Recommended Usage Example:**

```python
from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import adfuller

result = adfuller(x, regression='c', autolag='AIC')

# Output interpretation clearly
adf_statistic, p_value, used_lag, n_obs, critical_values, icbest = result

print('ADF Statistic:', adf_statistic)
print('p-value:', p_value)
print('Critical Values:')
for key, value in critical_values.items():
    print(f'   {key}: {value}')
```

---

## **4. Interpretation Quickly:**

| p-value                  | Stationarity Interpretation                    | Action                        |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| p-value ≤ 0.05           | Reject null hypothesis → **Stationary**        | Good, no differencing needed. |
| p-value > 0.05           | Fail to reject null → **Non-stationary**       | Differencing/transform needed |

---

## **Summary (Recommended Arguments Clearly):**

| Argument    | Recommended Value |
|-------------|-------------------|
| `maxlag`    | `None`            |
| `regression`| `'c'` *(default)* |
| `autolag`   | `'AIC'` *(default)* |

This combination is the standard, robust starting point and suits most practical scenarios.

---

### **In short:**

```python
adfuller(x, regression='c', autolag='AIC')
```

This is the **recommended best-practice usage** of the ADF test in Python's `statsmodels`.



Absolutely! Let’s walk through the **cointegration test** using `statsmodels.tsa.stattools.coint` in Python — what it does, how to interpret it, and **how to choose the right arguments**.

---

## **1. What is Cointegration?**

**Cointegration** tests whether two (or more) **non-stationary time series** move together in the long run — meaning a **linear combination of them is stationary**, even if each one is not.

### Real-world analogy:
Two stocks (say A and B) may individually follow random walks (non-stationary), but their **spread** (A - kB) may be stationary. That implies a long-term equilibrium relationship.

---

## **2. The Engle-Granger Cointegration Test**

The `coint()` function in `statsmodels` implements the **Engle-Granger two-step method**:

### Step 1:
Run a linear regression:  
\[
y = \beta x + \epsilon
\]

### Step 2:
Test the residuals \(\epsilon\) for **stationarity** using the **ADF test**.

- If the residuals are stationary → **y and x are cointegrated**
- If not → no cointegration (no long-term equilibrium)

---

## **3. Syntax of `statsmodels.tsa.stattools.coint`**

```python
from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import coint

coint(y, x, trend='c', method='aeg', maxlag=None, autolag='aic')
```

### **Key Arguments and Recommendations:**

| Argument     | Purpose | Recommended Value |
|--------------|---------|-------------------|
| `y`          | Dependent variable (e.g., stock A) | Required |
| `x`          | Regressor/independent variable (e.g., stock B) | Required |
| `trend`      | Type of deterministic trend to include in the regression | `'c'` *(default)* |
| `method`     | Cointegration test method (`'aeg'` = Engle-Granger) | `'aeg'` *(only option now)* |
| `maxlag`     | Maximum lag in ADF test for residuals | `None` |
| `autolag`    | Criterion to choose optimal lag | `'aic'` *(recommended)* |

---

### `trend` options (same as ADF):

| Value  | Meaning                        | When to use                                   |
|--------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `'c'`  | Constant (default)             | **Most common**, if your data has a non-zero mean |
| `'ct'` | Constant + linear trend        | If series appear to have a trend              |
| `'n'`  | No trend or constant           | Use with mean-zero data (rare)                |

---

## **4. Output of `coint()` function**

```python
score, pvalue, crit_values = coint(y, x)
```

| Output          | Meaning                                              |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `score`         | The test statistic (ADF of residuals)               |
| `pvalue`        | p-value for the cointegration test                  |
| `crit_values`   | Critical values at 1%, 5%, and 10% significance levels |

---

## **5. Example: Cointegration Test in Python**

```python
from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import coint
import pandas as pd

# Example: two time series (non-stationary)
y = df['StockA']
x = df['StockB']

score, pvalue, crit = coint(y, x, trend='c', autolag='aic')

print("Cointegration Test Statistic:", score)
print("p-value:", pvalue)
print("Critical Values:", crit)
```

---

## **6. How to Interpret the Result**

| If p-value     | Interpretation                            | Cointegrated? |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------|
| ≤ 0.05         | Reject null → **Residuals are stationary** → **Yes** |
| > 0.05         | Fail to reject null → Residuals non-stationary → **No** |

The null hypothesis of the cointegration test is:
> “**No cointegration** between y and x.”

---

## **7. Summary: Recommended Arguments for `coint()`**

```python
coint(y, x, trend='c', autolag='aic')
```

| Parameter | Recommended |
|-----------|-------------|
| `trend`   | `'c'` (constant, unless you see trend in data) |
| `autolag` | `'aic'` (auto lag selection via AIC)            |
| `maxlag`  | `None` (let autolag decide)                     |

---

### In Short:

- **Use `coint()` to test for long-term relationship** between two non-stationary series.
- Focus on the **p-value**: If it's ≤ 0.05 → series are cointegrated.
- **Exclude constant/trend terms only if you're sure** the data has zero mean or no drift — `'c'` is safest.

Let me know if you'd like help visualizing cointegration or seeing how the spread looks over time!
