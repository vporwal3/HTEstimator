In the previous development phase, I collaborated with the new Liquidity Director to further test the qualitative models for IBD-IOE and IBD Commercial. I evaluated stability under varying FFR scenarios, implementing the testing entirely in Python to validate Excel-based model results. This not only improved confidence in the models but also added a robust validation layer to the process.

ðŸ“Œ Performance Evaluation Comment (Mid-Year 2025)

During the first half of 2025, I contributed meaningfully across multiple high-priority initiatives within Credit Risk and Quantitative Modeling, consistently demonstrating technical ownership, initiative, and cross-team collaboration. My work spanned end-to-end model development, statistical research, dashboarding, and automation efforts â€” all aligned with improving model quality, accelerating execution, and supporting business and regulatory objectives.

1. Dynamic Credit Surveillance Tool â€“ Middle Market and Small Business
I led the full development of the DST codebase, supporting early credit deterioration detection across four client segments. This included identifying optimal data sources (CRR, CAM, Review), engineering a panel dataset using optimized parallel ETL (cutting run time to ~15 minutes), and building a preprocessing pipeline leveraging a new Weight of Evidence (WOE) binning technique that uses optimization methods to determine bin thresholds â€” improving AUC, precision, and recall by 8â€“10%.
I also integrated a novel MFA selection package that reduced model generation time from several hours to minutes. Finalized models achieved AUC >0.75 (vs. ~0.65 in legacy versions), offering significant improvements in predictive power. I also created a custom backtesting framework for panel data and led presentations to the credit risk team.
Business impact: The tool supports focused client reviews, allowing the credit risk team to prioritize the riskiest 100â€“200 clients across MM/SB portfolios.

2. Deposit Beta Redevelopment
I played a lead role in the redevelopment of beta models for three key products: IBD Commercial, Public Commercial MMDA, and MMDA Select Promo/Exec. I developed an interactive dashboard (Python + Plotly Dash) capable of handling 5M+ rows, enabling dynamic segmentation analysis and accelerating decision-making on grouping criteria.
Model improvements led to ~15% reductions in backtesting errors (MAE, RMSE) for Public Commercial MMDA, without compromising stability under different FFR scenarios.
Business impact: These models feed directly into NII and EVE calculations, supporting Treasuryâ€™s interest rate risk management framework.

3. PPNR Modeling Support
I provided flexible support across several income line items, including initial modeling for the Credit Card Income series and normalization strategies for Investment Banking & Debt Placement sub-items. I also contributed to internal research on model testing standards.
Though not a primary developer, I made consistent contributions and frequently stepped in when help was needed, managing priorities across projects.

4. C&I Loss Forecasting â€“ 2025 CASTA
To support an understaffed C&I modeling team, I developed a robust segmentation framework using rolling-window statistical testing (Chi-squared, Mann-Whitney, PCA), helping justify a shift from business group-based to commitment-based segmentation.
I also built a high-performance EDA dashboard (Plotly Dash) for interactive exploration of millions of rows, enabling the team to visualize and evaluate model drivers in real time.
Business impact: My contributions helped accelerate the model cycle for a CASTA-critical loss forecasting submission.

5. Due Diligence Report QA Automation
In collaboration with the KTO Automation team, I helped build two parallel solutions: (a) a statistical scoring engine and (b) a GenAI-based pipeline to flag and summarize risky elements in diligence reports.
Business impact: This modernized a legacy random-review process, improving coverage of high-risk reports while saving manual review time.

6. Transactions Data Extraction & Dashboarding




I led the ETL pipeline for extracting transaction data and built a Looker Studio dashboard to visualize trends and patterns in near real time.
Business impact: This foundational step supports integration of transactional signals into future credit risk models.

7. CRE Performance Database Prototype
I collaborated with our group head and senior executives to build a prototype structure for consolidating CRE loan performance data, currently siloed in Excel.
Business impact: This will support long-term efforts around monitoring, early warning systems, and credit risk modeling for CRE portfolios.

ðŸ”š Closing Summary

Across these efforts, I have taken initiative, delivered technically sound work, and continuously looked for ways to improve team efficiency â€” whether by introducing new packages, building tools to accelerate analysis, or stepping in to support other teams. Iâ€™ve grown in my ability to work independently while maintaining clear documentation and communication, and I look forward to continuing to contribute to model quality, automation, and strategic impact in the second half of 2025.
