Model Risk Report: Statistical Justification for Commitment-Based Segmentation

1. Executive Summary
	•	Purpose of segmentation
	•	Summary of methodology and findings
	•	Final recommendation

⸻

2. Background and Motivation
	•	Legacy segmentation strategy overview
	•	Rationale for exploring commitment-based segmentation
	•	Regulatory and business context

⸻

3. Data Overview
	•	Source of data and structure (panel nature, time span)
	•	Key fields used (commitment, defaults, credit features)
	•	Preprocessing and filtering rules
	•	Removal of invalid/negative commitments
	•	Handling of obligors with no defaults
	•	Rolling up to obligor level

⸻

4. Framework: Rolling Window Design
	•	Justification for rolling window
	•	Description of economic windows used
	•	Why fixed T₀ snapshots per window
	•	How windows align with macro trends
	•	Diagram of the pipeline (optional)

⸻

5. Method 1: Chi-Squared Test on Default Rates
	•	Purpose of the test
	•	Hypothesis formulation
	•	Construction of contingency table
	•	Assumptions and limitations
	•	Summary table of results by window
	•	Interpretation of test statistics
	•	Visualizations: bar plots / Cramér’s V

⸻

6. Method 2: Mann–Whitney U Test on Credit Drivers
	•	Rationale for non-parametric comparison
	•	Selection of variables (Risk Rating, Outstanding Amt, etc.)
	•	Hypothesis setup for each variable
	•	Segment-specific analysis (≤3MM vs >3MM)
	•	Summary of p-values across windows
	•	Limitations (e.g., cannot be used for >2 groups)
	•	Visual comparisons (boxplots or violin plots)

⸻

7. Method 3: PCA-Based Decomposition
	•	Purpose: Visual structural separation of segments
	•	Feature selection (scaled risk variables)
	•	Technical steps of PCA
	•	Explanation of principal components
	•	Plots: PCA by window (side-by-side for Commitment vs. Legacy)
	•	Interpretation of observed separation
	•	Handling outliers and overlap
	•	Summary of findings

⸻

8. Comparative Analysis
	•	Method-by-method comparison: commitment vs legacy
	•	Tradeoffs: parsimony vs. complexity
	•	Segment quality: size, default distribution, interpretability
	•	Model performance (optional if you ran PD models)

⸻

9. Conclusions and Recommendations
	•	Final summary of statistical evidence
	•	Does segmentation based on commitment make sense?
	•	When it works better (or not)
	•	Business and model development implications

⸻
